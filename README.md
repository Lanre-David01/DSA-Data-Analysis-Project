Conclusion

This analysis uncovered critical insights about how KMS operates:

Shipping Misalignments: Some low-priority orders used premium shipping methods, revealing potential overspending.
Customer Targeting Opportunities: High-value customers were identified by segment, allowing for better personalization and upselling.
Low-Performing Customers: The bottom 10 customers were flagged for retention strategies such as discounts and product bundles.
Regional Insights: Key regions with poor performance were highlighted, which can guide marketing or distribution focus.
Returned Orders: Returned items were linked to specific customer segments — helping improve quality control and post-sale service.
Overall, this project demonstrated how SQL can transform raw transactional data into strategic business intelligence — driving smarter decisions, revenue growth, and operational efficiency.
